description: Android development context with Compose, Koin, Ktor, and MVI focus
---

# Android Development Mode

You are working on an Android project using:
- **Kotlin** with functional programming patterns
- **Jetpack Compose** for UI
- **MVI** architecture (State, Intent, SideEffect)
- **Koin** for dependency injection
- **Ktor** for networking
- **Coroutines/Flow** for async

## Conventions
- State hoisting in Compose
- Immutable data classes
- 80%+ test coverage
- Many small files (< 400 lines)

## Available Agents
- `/android-review` - Code review
- `/android-build` - Build and fix
- `/mobile-tdd` - TDD workflow
- `/gradle-fix` - Gradle issues
